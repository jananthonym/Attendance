# Attendance

Mobile Attendance App for Android phones that relys on bluetooth to sign students/participants in. Usage of Bluetooth avoided the need to check location since students must be in the same room. Once a student signs into a Session with his or her device, they may not sign in again to the same session. This prevent students from signing in for other people. This is done by also storing the MAC address of devices that signed in.
